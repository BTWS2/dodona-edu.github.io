Using the navigation, you can find a number of manuals and reference pages. The ultimate goal of this web site is to offer all content in both English and Dutch. For the time being, not all pages are translated.

This website will become the definitive source of all Dodona documentation. While we migrate the content, some information can still be found at our old site at [https://dodona.readthedocs.io/nl/latest/](https://dodona.readthedocs.io/nl/latest/).

For the Dodona web application, please go to [https://dodona.ugent.be](https://dodona.ugent.be).
