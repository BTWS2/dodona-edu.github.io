# The Coder's Apprentice

Learn to code with Python 3.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

In [Dodona](https://dodona-edu.github.io/nl/guides/getting-started/) you'll find an **interactive edition** of the book [The Coder's Apprentice](http://www.spronck.net/pythonbook/dutchindex.xhtml) by Pieter Spronck (Tilburg University). The book aims to teach **secondary school** students how to code with **Python 3**. The course is available both in [English](https://dodona.ugent.be/nl/courses/293/) and in [Dutch](https://dodona.ugent.be/nl/courses/293/).

It's a good idea to logon to Dodona first, before getting started with the interactive book. By registering for the course (which is free) you will be able to mark the sections you processed as read and to submit solutions for the programming assignments. Dodona will automatically give you feedback on each submitted solution and you can make use of a [visuele debugger](http://www.pythontutor.com/){:target="_blank"} to hunt for errors in your code. This way, you can monitor your own process while going through the learning activities.

## How do I use the course with the students of my class?

If you want to dive into the course with a group of students, we recommend that you take a copy of the existing course. This is as easy as choosing the option *Copy this course* from the course menu.

Being the administrator of the copied version of the course gives you the complete freedom to set it up according to the needs of your target audience:

- adjust the learning path of the course
  - rearrange, add, delete or temporarily hide chapters and sections
  - rearrange, add, delete or temporarily hide programming assignments
  - add your own programming assignments
- set deadlines for specific tasks
- monitor the progress of your students
- review the submitted solutions of your students

## Why can't I copy the course?

To create your own courses (from scratch or starting from existing courses) or to create your reading assignments or programming exercises, you need to have additional access rights on Dodona that are not included in the standard account. We will grant you these rights as soon as possible upon simple request by email (dodona@ugent.be) or via the [contact form] (https://dodona.ugent.be/en/contact).
