# The Coder's Apprentice

In [Dodona](https://dodona.ugent.be){:target="_blank"} you'll find an **interactive edition** of the book [The Coder's Apprentice](http://www.spronck.net/pythonbook/index.xhtml){:target="_blank"} by Pieter Spronck (Tilburg University). The book aims to teach **secondary school** students how to code with **Python 3**. We provide both the [English](https://dodona.ugent.be/nl/courses/293/) and the [Dutch](https://dodona.ugent.be/nl/courses/293/) edition.

## Learn to code with Python 3

It's a good idea to logon to Dodona before getting started with the interactive edition. After registering for the course (which is free) you'll be able to mark sections you processed as read and to submit solutions for the programming assignments. Dodona immediately gives feedback on each submitted solution and you can use the [visual debugger](http://www.pythontutor.com/){:target="_blank"} to hunt for errors in your code. As such, you can monitor your own process while going through the learning material.

## How do I use the course with the students of my class?

If you want to dive into the interactive course with a group of students, we recommend to make your own copy. This is easily done with the option *Copy this course* from the course menu: follow the step-by-step workflow.

Being the administrator of the copied course enables you to set it up according to the needs of your target audience:

- adjust the learning path of the course
  - rearrange, add, delete or temporarily hide chapters, sections and exercises
  - add your own programming assignments and share them with your colleagues
- set deadlines
- monitor the progress of students (individually or as a group)
- organize tests and exams
- review submitted solutions
- discuss submitted solutions in class (pseudonymized in demo mode)
- appoint colleagues as fellow course administrators


## Why can't I copy the course?

Creating your own courses (from scratch or starting from existing courses) or creating your own tutorials or programming exercises requires specific access rights on Dodona. These privileges are not granted by default, but teachers can send us a request by email (dodona@ugent.be) or via the [contact form] (https://dodona.ugent.be/en/contact). Team Dodona will process any incoming request as soon as possible.


## How can I publish my own learning materials on Dodona?

Dodona allows you to publish your own **tutorials** and **programming exercises with support for automated feedback**. You design the learning materials in your own [git repository](https://dodona-edu.github.io/en/guides/new-exercise-repo/). By [linking](https://dodona-edu.github.io/en/guides/new-exercise-repo/#3-de-webhook-instellen) the repository with Dodona, you establish automatic synchronisation such that Dodona always publishes the latest versions of the materials. Elsewhere in the Dodona documentation you can read how to [configure](https://dodona-edu.github.io/en/references/exercise-config/) and [structure](https://dodona-edu.github.io/en/references/exercise-directory-structure/) the learning materials, and how to add [multimedia and special formatting](https://dodona-edu.github.io/nl/references/exercise-description/) to their descriptions.

Like the [originale book](http://www.spronck.net/pythonbook/index.xhtml){:target="_blank"}, the [interactive ediction](https://dodona.ugent.be/nl/courses/293/){:target="_blank"} of The Coder's Apprentice is also released under the [Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://github.com/dodona-edu/programmeursleerling/blob/master/LICENSE.md){:target="_blank"} license. In addition, its source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dodona-edu/programmeursleerling){:target="_blank"}, allowing you to via the configurations of all learning materials. You can use these configurations as an example while developing your own learning materials for Dodona.
