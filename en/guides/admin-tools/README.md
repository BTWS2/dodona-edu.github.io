## Impersonating users

As a [teacher](#teacher) you can temporarily take control of the[user account](/en/for-students#user-account) of a [student](#student). This allows you to see the personalised version of Dodona through the eyes of the student. This can be useful to answer questions about something a student encountered an issue in Dodona or when they want to perform actions on Dodona. Additionally, it allows you to perform actions in the name of the student, such as [registering](/en/for-students#course-register) for a [course](/en/course-management#course) or [submitting](/en/for-students#submit-solution) a [solution](/en/for-students#solution) for an [exercise](/en/for-students#exercise).

::: tip Important

When you [register](/en/for-students#course-register)
for a [course](/en/course-management#course) or [submit](/en/for-students#submit-solution) a
[solution](/en/for-students#solution)
for an
[exercise](/en/for-students#exercise) while [impersonating](#impersonating-users) a [student](#students),
those actions will have the same effect as if they were performed by the student himself.
Make sure that you want to perform these actions in name of the student, otherwise you should [return](#stop-impersonating) to your own account to perform the actions as yourself.
:::

### Stop impersonating
While you are [impersonating](#impersonating-users) a user, a notification is displayed at the top of the page to remind you of this fact.
It contains a link that allows you to stop the impersonating process and thus return to your own [account](/en/for-students#user-account).
