## Navigating to a course

Course managers can build [courses]() out of [exercises]() grouped in [exercise series](). If you are [registered]() for a course it is possible to submit solutions for exercises belonging to that course. There are different places you can select a course:

- On the left side of your homepage, there are cards for all the courses you are registered in, grouped by academic year. Use the search bar at the top of the homepage to search for a specific course by searching for the name of the course, the teacher, or the academic year. Select a course by clicking on the colored title bar on the card of the course or by clicking on <span class="guilabel">GO TO THIS COURSE</span> at the bottom of the course card.

- If you have pending registration requests for courses, then you can find these courses in the panel <span class="guilabel">Awaiting approval</span> in the right column of your homepage. You can select one of these courses by clicking on its name.
