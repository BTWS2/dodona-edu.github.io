## Dodona 6.0 - 2022-08-18

Users with a personal Google (Gmail) or Microsoft (Hotmail, Outlook, ...) account can now create an account on Dodona! Previously, accounts needed to belong to an institutional Office 365 or Google Workspace subscription, but this restriction has been lifted.

To prevent students from using their private account (instead of their school account) to subscribe to official school courses, course administrators must explicitly allow private accounts in their courses if they wish to.

The privacy policy has been updated to reflect this change, but contains no changes for existing users.

All details about this Dodona version can be found in the [GitHub release discussion](https://github.com/dodona-edu/dodona/discussions/3900).
