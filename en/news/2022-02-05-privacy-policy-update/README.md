In Dodona release 5.3.1, we updated our privacy policy. In that version, we stopped making use of Google Analytics so it is no longer needed to mention it in our privacy policy. The following sentences were removed:

> Dodona uses Firebase and Google Analytics to monitor site performance. No personal data is ever sent to these services.

As always, the most recent version can be found on [https://dodona.ugent.be/privacy](https://dodona.ugent.be/privacy).
