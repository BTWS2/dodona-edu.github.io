> On March 29 and April 26 2021, we gave a webinar on the new learning outcomes on computational thinking. You can rewatch the webinars on YouTube, but they are in Dutch. 

In part 1, we give more information about the new learning outcomes on computational thinking. Next to a short introduction to Dodona, there's also more information about the [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2iW_rkiCt7UqxL47lGkBaTgApj_QHJ0K) of Dirk Peeters. Part 2 is all about Dodona and how you can use the platform in your classes.

Have fun watching!
