To avoid confusion and to be more consistent with other judges, the `pythia` judge has been renamed to `python`. This change was made automatically and requires no further action from users. In addition, the `biopythia` judge was merged into the Python judge, since they used the same codebase. All python exercises can now just use the `python` judge.
