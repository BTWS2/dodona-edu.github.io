The release of Dodona 3.2 brings a handy navigation menu to the exercise page, a completely renewed way to download submissions and brings back the scoresheet for a course.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Navigation for exercises

From now on, if you view an exercise through an exercise series, there will be a menu in the right margin that you can use to switch easily to the other exercises in that series.

## Export of submissions

The export of submissions received a full make-over. Using a wizard, you can now download all your submissions per course, per series or just all of them. As a course admin, you can do this for all users of your course. This new tool has a few options so that you can get started immediately with the archive you download.

## Course scoresheet

Previously, you could download a CSV file at the course level as a course admin to view the status of students within a course. To bring this functionality more in line with the scoresheet of a series, we also provided a page within Dodona to view the course scoresheet. The earlier option to download the scoresheet is also back, of course. We also made the generation of the scoresheet faster and the usability of the page better.
