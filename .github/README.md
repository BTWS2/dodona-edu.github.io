# Dodona documentation website

This website uses VitePress and serves the documentation in both English and Dutch. Therefore, it is important that the same directory structure is used within the `nl` and `en` subdirectories. Changes to the configuration can be made in `.vitepress/config.js`.

Pushing to `main` will automatically publish this website.

To test locally, run `yarn install` and `yarn dev`, to build, run `yarn build`.
