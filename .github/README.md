# Dodona documentation website

> Because of the limitations of github pages, the compiled website files can only be served from the branch called `master`. This is why the default branch of this repo is `main` and contains the source of the documentation.

Pushing to `main` will automatically publish this website.

To test locally, run `yarn install` and `yarn dev`, to build, run `yarn build`.
